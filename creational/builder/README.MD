The concept behind the Builder Pattern is to separate the construction of an object from its representation.
in this context: construction is about the exporting logic, the logic for constructing a presentation.
the representation on the other hand: is the target format.
=> So in the context, we want to use the builder pattern to: separate the "exporting logic" from the "presentation format"
