With the Bridge Pattern, we can build a simple, yet flexible hierarchy that can grow independent of each other.
Whenever we have a hierarchy that grows in two different dimensions, we need to split it into two seperate heriarchies (in our case Feature & Implementation).
When we have a hierarchy that can grow in two different dimensions, with the Bridge Pattern we can split this ugly, complexe, hierarchy into two seperate herirachies that can grow independetly.
// in other word, get the composed interface and implement whatever you can.
