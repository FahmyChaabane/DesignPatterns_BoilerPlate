As the name implies, the Proxy Pattern allows us to create a proxy or an agent for a real object. So if you want to talk to an object, will talk to it through its proxy or agent, this agent will takes our messages and forwards it to the target object.
// as u can see, we load many ebooks in memory, but we only going to open one of them. Creating an ebook is kinda costy, because we have to read it from the disk and store it in the memory, with Proxy pattern we can create an object that simulate a real ebook, but it's going to load this ebook on demand only when we need it.
=> when our app launches, we will not load 100s of ebooks, we are only going to list them. and we get this information from our db. when user tries to open an ebook, this is the moment when we read the ebook from the disk and load it into our memory.
